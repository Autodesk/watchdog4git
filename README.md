## Watchdog4Git

Watchdog4Git is a bot ðŸ¤– that checks commits pushed to GitHub for common Git problems.
If the bot identifies a problem, then it notifies the committer by posting a comment to the commit.

Currently Watchdog4Git checks only for [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) related problems.
The watchdog warns if large files are added to the repository that should be tracked by Git LFS.

In the future Watchdog4Git could also check for [Git Submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) problems, [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) problems, and other Git related problems.

### Getting started

1. Build Watchdog4Git:
```
make
```
1. Deploy the `watchdog4git` executable to a server.
1. Run Watchdog4Git on the server.
1. Create and install a `watchdog4git` GitHub App and point it to your server.
1. Add a `.github/watchdog.yml` file to your repository that configures the Git LFS checks:

```
# Contact for users in notification comments (can include GitHub @mentions)
helpContact: "[#your-channel](https://yourcompany.slack.com/messages/ABC1234)"

# General size threshold for files that should be in Git LFS
# (uncompressed size in bytes)
lfsSizeThreshold: 512000

# List of files that are exempt from the general size threshold
# (typically large text files, optional)
lfsSizeExemptions: |
    testdata/largetext.txt
    *.xml
    
# Size threshold for exempt files that should be in Git LFS
# (uncompressed size in bytes, optional)
lfsSizeExemptionsThreshold: 20000000

# Switch to turn on/off Git LFS file size suggestions
lfsSuggestionsEnabled: Yes
```


### How does it work?

Watchdog4Git receives GitHub [webhook](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/) events for every push.
The payload contains a list of commits whose metadata contain the list of added, modified, and deleted files.

For each added or modified file in each commit, the App [queries the file size](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/) and checks if the file does not match a Git LFS path pattern but is larger than the defined threshold. It then marks the file as a *suggestion*.
All suggestions are rolled up in a single commit comment and posted to the commit on GitHub.
